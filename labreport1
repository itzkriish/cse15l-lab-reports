## Lab Report 1

* Step 1: Installing VS Code *
- I already had VS Code installed on my computer and so I simply just opened a new window on it.
- Then I started a new terminal to enter the commands I needed to start the remote connection. I also made sure to switch to bash as recommended by the tutor.
- Here is how my screen looked once I did that:

* Step 2: Remotely Connecting *
- To establish the remote connection, I first reset the password associated with my CSE 15L account on the website: (link)
- Once that was done I ran the following command in the terminal to establish the connection: 
- Unfortunately for me, that did not work and I got an error. This was a pretty common error that many in the class faced. The TA and tutors asked me to try logging in with
my UCSD TritonLink Account. That did not work for me as well due to an error out of my control. 
- Here is a screenshot of the errors I faced:

- After this point, I was instructed to move on with the rest of the tasks and so I was unable to successfully establish the remote connection or run the commands.
