# CSE 15L
## Lab Report 1

** Step 1: Installing VS Code **
- I already had VS Code installed on my computer and so I simply just opened a new window on it.
- Then I started a new terminal to enter the commands I needed to start the remote connection. I also made sure to switch to bash as recommended by the tutor.
- Here is how my screen looked once I did that:

** Step 2: Remotely Connecting **
- To establish the remote connection, I first reset the password associated with my CSE 15L account on this [Website] (https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
- Then, I opened VS Code and opened up a new terminal and ran the following command: ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu (replace zz with the letters from your specific account ID).
- It then prompted me for a password that I had just created and after entering that, the remote connection was successfully established.
- *NOTE*: When typing the password, the characters do not show on screen but are still getting typed. So, type out the password fully and then press enter.
- Here is how my screen looked once the remote connection was successfully established:

** Step 3: Running Commands **
- I ran a few commands to test out how everything worked. 
- It was interesting to see the outputs I got and changes that occured from the commands.
- Here is a snippet of what I did and what it resulted in:
